Welcome to the official documentation site of v-moravec/ui. Whether you are a developer or designer, you'll find all the necessary resources here to get started and effectively utilize our product.

v-moravec/ui is dedicated to providing you with sophisticated, user-friendly solutions designed to enhance your workflow. Our goal is to streamline the processes of development and design, making them more efficient and accessible for everyone.

You can't really use our library as a dependency. Instead of installing a package into your project you are supposed to pick the components and blocks you need and get their source code. There are two ways of doing that:

- using our CLI
- copying the files manually from [Github](https://github.com/v-moravec/ui)

To get started, navigate through our documentation to understand the setup process, explore the core features, and see how our tools can be tailored to fit your needs.
