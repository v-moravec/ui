description: Built on top of amazing open source projects
---

Thank you to all the developers and their open source projects that have played an important role in making this project possible.

- [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) - Pioneer of this way of thinking about UI libraries and creator of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).
- [Authors of shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) - This helped me look for components which would be very hard to optimise by myself.
- [headlessui](https://headlessui.com/) - Fully accessible UI components which I used to build this collection.
- [NuxtUI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) - Although the library is really amazing, I prefer to own the code and adjust the functionality to my liking.
Anyways thank you for a lot of utilities which make this documentation much better and easier to write.
